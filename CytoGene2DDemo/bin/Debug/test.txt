<:\fb>Cytogenetics <:\fr>is a branch of genetics that is concerned with the study of the structure and function of the cell, especially the chromosomes. It includes routine analysis of <:\fi>G-banded chromosomes, <:\fr>other cytogenetic banding techniques, as well as molecular cytogenetics such as fluorescent in <:\fi>situ <:\fr>hybridization <:\cb>(FISH) <:\ck>and comparative genomic hybridization <:\cb>(CGH).
>>History
>>>Early years
<:\ck>Chromosomes were first observed in plant cells by <:\cr\fb>Karl Wilhelm von Nageli <:\ck\fr>in 1842. Their behavior in animal (salamander) cells was described by Walther Flemming, the discoverer of mitosis, in 1882. The name was coined by another German anatomist, <:\cr\fb>von Waldeyer <:\ck\fr>in 1888.
In textbooks, the number of human chromosomes remained at <:\cr>48 <:\ck>for over thirty years. New techniques were needed to correct this error. <:\fb>Joe Hin Tjio <:\fr>working in <:\fi\fb>Albert Levan's lab <:\fr>was responsible for finding the approach:
#Using cells in culture
#Pre-treating cells in a hypotonic solution, which swells them and spreads the chromosomes
#Arresting mitosis in metaphase by a solution of colchicine
#Squashing the preparation on the slide forcing the chromosomes into a single plane
#Cutting up a photomicrograph and arranging the result into an indisputable karyogram.
>>Fluorescent in situ hybridization
Fluorescent in situ hybridization refers to using fluorescently labeled probe to hybridize to cytogenetic cell preparations.
In addition to standard preparations <:\cb>FISH <:\ck>can also be performed on:
*bone marrow smears
*blood smears
*paraffin embedded tissue preparations
*enzymatically dissociated tissue samples
*uncultured bone marrow
*uncultured amniocytes
*cytospin preparations
